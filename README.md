# Minimum-Value-of-n-log-n
For each function (n log n) and time t, determine the largest size n of a problem that can be solved in time t, assuming that the algorithm to solve theproblem takes (n log n) microseconds.
I was given this problem for homework, and I needed to whip up some quick code to solve it.
